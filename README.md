# HealthNetTBD
This is a Hospital management software designed and currently being worked on by myself and 4 other team mates. The application is meant to automate and simplify performance management processes, simplify patient communication and log activity of all activities taken by the Health Care professionals as well as the patients. This is a web application and is being developed using Python and Django Frameworks. Version 2.0 is released and is available on GitHub. It will be released in its full capacity by January 2017.



In order to run it make sure you have a python version higher 2.7 installed and django installed as well.
cd into wherever you have the HealthNetTBD saved.
type in the following command in your terminal or command prompt :

"python manage.py runserver"

This would provide a local IP address(http://127.0....). Copy this IP address and put into your browser. add "/accounts" in the browser text box and press enter. You should be at the HomePage of HealthNet Application. 


Hope this helps.
